1) NON-MATH courses can be pushed to co-op terms (at the expense of interesting courses)
2) Non-math requirements:
a. Depth requirement: ENGL 306A/B (intro to linguistics, english grammer) 
b. Science: SCI 207/KIN 146/HTLH 101
c. Social science: ECON 212 + ECON 451/201/206
d. Other: PHIL 145/CLAS 104/PHIL 256
